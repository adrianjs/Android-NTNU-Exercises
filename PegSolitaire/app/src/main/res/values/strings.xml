        The game is played by jumping over pegs into open spaces.
        The pegs can jump horizontally or vertically.
        The game ends when there are no more possible moves, and the score is based on the time
        taken to reach this point, as well as how many pegs are left on the board.
        You can choose between two boards, both of which are somewhat similar in difficulty.
